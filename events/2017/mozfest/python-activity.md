### Building a driver and app using databox python library.
The existing databox python library is found [here](https://github.com/me-box/lib-python-databox). This contains two sample drivers and apps, 
which could be use as a starting point.
There are few ideas:
1. Writing databox driver for Philip Hue New Sensors - this could be done by using [Philip Hue Python library](https://github.com/studioimaginaire/phue) and a app using this data.
2. Making [occupancy-as-a-service](https://github.com/me-box/lib-python-databox/tree/master/samples/driver-oaas) sample app interactive by integrating online IP camera.
3. Building an app similar to [Mspy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSpy) which filters messanging apps encrpted data.
4. Building apps using [Sensingkit](https://github.com/me-box/driver-sensingkit).
