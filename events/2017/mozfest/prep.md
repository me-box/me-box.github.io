## To be prepared for the day

You need a computer capable of running Docker. Cloning our repo uses approximately 2GB of data so could you please do this before attending the venue to avoid overloading the WiFi.

If you are interested in attending dinner after the event please let someone from the Databox team know during lunch to allow time to book a table at the restaurant. Please note, the project is not able to cover the costs of the social event so attendees would be expected to pay for what they have.
